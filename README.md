# Expense Tracker
I already done "[Expense Tracker](https://github.com/dkumza/Personal_Expense_Tracker)" on 2021-Oct. But I wanted to learn some features and build with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js. The application allows users to add transactions, view their balance, and see a chart of their expenses by category. Sadly I don't know yet BackEnd part, but in future I wish to finish this app in more modern way, with much more posibilitys...

## Installation

To install the application, clone the repository and run the following command:

    npm install
    
## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

  
     npm run dev
    
This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. 
Or simply you can check already prebuilded version online - [HERE](https://dkumza.github.io/personal-expenses/)
